"""THE ONE CONFIG FILE for this agent.

Every runtime knob lives here, and every value can be overridden by an
environment variable of the same name — so "configuring a deployment"
always means the same thing: look at this file, set the env vars you
need on your platform, done. Changing model or deployment platform
later should only require reading this file.

=== SECRETS / ENV-VAR CHECKLIST (what to set on your platform) ===============
| Env var           | Needed when…                          | Default        |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------|
| PORT              | deploying remotely — most platforms   | 8000           |
|                   | (Railway/Render/Fly) inject it, which |                |
|                   | automatically switches to HTTP mode   |                |
| MCP_TRANSPORT     | you want to force a transport         | auto (see below)|
| HOST              | rarely — bind address for HTTP mode   | 0.0.0.0        |
| MODEL             | your /api code calls an LLM           | claude-opus-4-8|
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | your /api code calls Claude           | (none)         |
==============================================================================
The starter agent needs NONE of these locally — stdio + no secrets.
